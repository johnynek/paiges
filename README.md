# Paiges

## Summary

An implementation of [Wadler's "A Prettier Printer"](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf).
This code is a direct port of the code in section 7 of this paper, with an attempt to be idiomatic
in scala.

This algorithm is optimal and bounded. From the paper:

> Say that a pretty printing algorithm is optimal if it chooses line
> breaks so as to avoid overflow whenever possible; say that it is
> bounded if it can make this choice after looking at no more than the
> next w characters, where w is the line width. Hughes notes that
> there is no algorithm to choose line breaks for his combinators that
> is optimal and bounded, while the layout algorithm presented here
> has both properties.

The name is a reference to the [Paige compositor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Compositor)
and the fact that it helps you layout pages.

Some selling points of this code:

 1. Lazy, O(1) concatenation
 2. Competitive performance (e.g. 3-5x slower than `mkString`)
 3. Elegantly handle indentation
 4. Flexible line-wrapping strategies
 5. Lawful equality and ordering
 6. Functional cred ;)

## Benchmarks

The Paiges benchmarks are written against JMH. To run them, you'll
want to use a command like this from SBT:

```
benchmark/jmh:run -wi 5 -i 5 -f1 -t1 bench.PaigesBenchmark
```

By default the values reported are *ops/ms* (operations per
millisecond), so higher numbers are better.

The parameters used here are:

 * `-wi`: the number of times to run during warmup
 * `-i`: the number of times to benchmark
 * `-f`: the number of processes to use during benchmarking
 * `-t`: the number of threads to use during benchmarking

In other words, the example command-line runs one thread in one
process, with a relatively small number of warmups + runs (so that it
will finish relatively quickly).
